# Image Processing Application

## Overview

The **Image Processing Application** is a Python-based graphical tool designed for easy and intuitive image processing. It provides functionalities such as image capturing from a webcam, selecting images from files, and applying various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The processed images can be saved with unique filenames, making it a powerful tool for both beginners and enthusiasts in the field of image processing.

## Features

### 1. **Image Input Options**
- **Take Picture**: Captures an image using the webcam.
- **Choose Picture**: Allows the user to select an image from the local file system.

### 2. **Image Display**
- Displays the selected or captured image in a resized format using PIL and ImageTk within the application interface.
- The interface also provides labels and buttons for a user-friendly experience.

### 3. **Image Processing Techniques**
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the image to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor`.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Smoothens the image and reduces noise with `cv2.GaussianBlur`.
- **Edge Detection**: Detects edges using the Canny algorithm with `cv2.Canny`.
- **Thresholding**: Applies binary and adaptive thresholding using `cv2.threshold` and `cv2.adaptiveThreshold`.
- **Morphological Operations**: Includes:
  - **Dilation**: Expands bright areas in the image.
  - **Erosion**: Shrinks bright areas.
  - **Opening**: Removes small objects from the foreground.
  - **Closing**: Fills small holes in the foreground.
  - **Gradient**: Computes the difference between dilation and erosion.
  - **Top Hat**: Extracts small bright regions on a dark background.
  - **Black Hat**: Extracts small dark regions on a bright background.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Enhances the contrast of the image using `cv2.equalizeHist`.
- **Laplacian Filter**: Detects edges using the Laplacian operator.
- **Bilateral Filter**: Reduces noise while preserving edges using `cv2.bilateralFilter`.

### 4. **Save Processed Images**
- Saves processed images with unique filenames generated using UUIDs and timestamps to avoid overwriting existing files.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and webcam interaction.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image manipulation and display in the GUI.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations used in image processing.
- **OS and UUID**: For file operations and unique filename generation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: `opencv-python`, `Pillow`, `numpy`.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-app.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python Pillow numpy
   ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Launch the application by running the script.
2. **Select an Image**:
   - Use the **Take Picture** button to capture an image from the webcam.
   - Use the **Choose Picture** button to select an image from your computer.
3. **Process the Image**:
   - Click on **Process Image** to apply various image processing techniques.
   - A new window will open, displaying the processed images in a grid.
4. **Save Processed Images**:
   - Click the **Save Images** button to save all processed images to a specified directory with unique filenames.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structures
1. **Lists**:
   - Used to store processed images and image processing functions.
   - Example: `self.processed_images` is a list holding tuples of processed images and their names.
2. **Tuples**:
   - Used for specifying parameters in image processing functions, such as kernel sizes.
3. **Strings**:
   - Used for storing file paths, image names, and messages displayed in the application.
4. **Dictionaries (Implicitly)**:
   - Tuples are used similarly to dictionaries to map image processing function names to their respective operations.

### Algorithms
1. **Image Processing Algorithms**:
   - **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts BGR images to grayscale using OpenCV.
   - **Gaussian Blur**: Applies a smoothing filter to reduce noise.
   - **Edge Detection**: Detects edges using the Canny algorithm.
   - **Thresholding**: Applies binary and adaptive thresholding techniques.
   - **Morphological Operations**: Performs operations like dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.
   - **Histogram Equalization**: Enhances image contrast.
   - **Laplacian Filter**: Used for edge detection.
   - **Bilateral Filtering**: Preserves edges while reducing noise.
2. **File Handling**:
   - Uses Python's `os` and `filedialog` for browsing and saving files.
3. **GUI Layout and Event Handling**:
   - Uses Tkinterâ€™s layout managers (`pack` and `grid`) and event-driven programming.
4. **Unique Filename Generation**:
   - Uses `uuid.uuid4` and `datetime` to generate unique filenames for saving images.

## Example Code Snippet
```python
# Example of Grayscale Conversion
processed_image = cv2.cvtColor(self.cv_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
```

## Future Improvements
- Add more image processing features, such as contour detection and object recognition.
- Implement a settings panel for users to customize processing parameters.
- Add support for batch processing of multiple images.
